# Machine Coding Questions

Daily machine coding practice — problem breakdown, thought process, and implementation.

Each problem folder contains:
- `README.md` — Problem statement, requirements, complexity analysis
- `thought-process.md` — Phase-by-phase thinking (clarify → DS → interface → code → extend)
- `solution/` — Implementation files split by responsibility
- `tests/` — pytest test cases

## References

The `_references/` folder contains Python concepts learned during practice — built from real usage, not theory.
